# HappyFeet-s-VRift-Simulator
A simulator for MouseHunt's Valour Rift

The beginRun() function of the VRift class allows for a single run, returning the floor reached, eclipse reached and hunts taken. 
The collectData() function performs a number of VRift runs (placed in the function argument) and generates basic statistics based on them at the end.
